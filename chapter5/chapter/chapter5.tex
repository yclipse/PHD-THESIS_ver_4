\chapter{Core-scale Analysis of Two Phase Flow and Trapping in Pre-salt Shrub Lithology}
In this chapter the results of two core-flooding experiments will be shown. The core-flooding experiments were conducted on sub-samples of a Pre-salt ‘shrub’ core sample. The variable of these two experiments are the organic (oil) phase used： Pre-salt dead crude oil and mineral oil (99\% n-dodecane) were used as different organic fluid phase to examine the difference of pore-scale fluid flow of a simple organic composition against a complex organic composition as in real Pre-salt petroleum reservoir. The imaging facility adopted is the X-ray micro-CT facility in Edinburgh, the imaging time of a single CT volume was about 50 minutes per scan. So the experiments were imaged statically before and after each injection stage.
